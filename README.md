## What's this about?
This repository contains my solutions to the bioinformatics problems from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info). The site hosts 285 problems in total, and my goal is to eventually solve and include them all here.

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific Rosalind problem, named according to its problem code. Only the solution code is included — datasets are intentionally excluded. If you’d like to run the solutions, you can download the required datasets directly from the Rosalind website.
